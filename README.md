# Laravel Filament + k8s

Project demo for my Laravel and Kubernetes workshop with deployment on Azure Kubernetes Service and DigitalOcean Kubernetes.

This project is a simple demo. I chose to use FrankenPHP with an app server, but alternatively, you could use RoadRunner, Swoole, or Open Swoole. In this setup, there is a Docker Compose file that initializes services locally.
