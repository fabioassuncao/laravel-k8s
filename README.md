# Laravel k8s

Project demo for my Laravel and Kubernetes workshop with deployment on Azure Kubernetes Service and DigitalOcean Kubernetes.

This project is a simple demo. I chose to use FrankenPHP with an app server, but alternatively, you could use RoadRunner, Swoole, or Open Swoole. In this setup, there is a Docker Compose file that initializes services locally.

## Included Items

* PHP 8.3
* [Laravel](https://laravel.com/)
* [Laravel Octane](https://laravel.com/docs/10.x/octane)
* [FrankenPHP](https://frankenphp.dev/)
* [AKS](https://azure.microsoft.com/pt-br/products/kubernetes-service)
* [DOKS](https://www.digitalocean.com/products/kubernetes)

## Upcoming Meetings

This repository is the initial part of something larger. We will have a project with services developed in NodeJS (NestJS), Go, and PHP (Laravel), all containerized and deployed in a Kubernetes cluster.
